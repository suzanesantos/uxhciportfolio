                            <p>AR and VR technologies increase each year, and so do their applicabilities. More fields, such as healthcare, sports and construction adhere to these technologies and a way to enhance their products and services. As a result, most of their end users would have a more engaging experience. Here are three concepts of AR and VR to illustrate that.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Cars, car technology, road construction and / or infrastructure
                                    </strong>
                                    <br>
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                    <p>Being able to see the project done before breaking a single brick would be perfect for city authorities responsible for the city infrastructure and for the private sector also. By using VR glasses, authorities, future homeowners, and company chiefs could see how their project would look in real life. This possibility could give a more immersive experience by providing an extra-dimensional sense of the space. That would not be possible by just looking at 2d or 3d models.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>

                                <li>
                                    
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Sports</strong>
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <p>In sports, fans could be “present” when watching the games or matches of their favorite athletes. By wearing VR glasses, fans and supporters could attend the games and matches. They would have the choice to select the place where they want to watch it. For instance, during a football or basketball match they could sit at a privileged area of the stadium or next to the players at the players' bench. That could provide a more immersive and affordable experience for those supporters who could not pay for the tickets or travel to attend the matches.

                                <p>In an attempt to diminish the littering problem in big cities, a more engaging solution could be provided by using AR applications on garbage bins across the city. A narrative would be created where a person would have to take action. Here is how it would work. With a mobile, and the camera on, a person would scan the QR code to reveal which monster s/he would be feeding. On the garbage bin it would say “Feed the monster before it gets angry”. The person could execute this task by putting in the garbage bin disposable objects that otherwise would be likely going to the streets.

<br>
                    <p>SKETCHAR is an innovative drawing mobile app that makes it easier to take the first step into drawing and lettering. As I am starting into the bullet journal world, lettering is a technique which I had to improve. This app helps people to follow great designs by following the drawings from the screen as it is ‘’reflected’’ on the paper. I think this AR app is interesting, because it has different features by using AI technology to transform a photo into a drawing and AR to create masks for social media such as Snapchat. Last but not least, this new way to learn to draw empowers the user to start drawing. Looking at the screen and trying to copy a design can be frustrating, because your drawing won’t be the same. Thus, this app makes learning to draw a fun process and less frustrating experience.

                        <p>For this assignment we worked with A-frame, which is a web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences. Some of the basic concepts covered were: shape, texture and animation. Here are some illustrations of the topics covered.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                                <strong>02 Shape</strong>
                                <br>
                           
                            <br>
                                <p>By using some shapes, I could create this scene. This was possible by adjusting the rings radius and position. To compose the scene I added other shapes such as sphere, plane, cone and box. Other attribution was also used, such as rotation for the cone.
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                    <p>For this part we had to work with animations. The task was to invert the direction of the rotation to counter clockwise. That was possible by changing the ‘’+” sign to “-” sign in the function <i>spin()</i>.</p>
                                   <br>
                                    <div>

                                <p>Following I changed the speed by putting  <i>easeInOutElastic</i> in the easing element.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Last I played around by adding interactivity. When the camera feature targets the specified model, it changes the color. When it leaves the model, the original color comes back.</p>

                                <p>For this part of the assignment, we had to follow the instructions of a game tutorial, by using a blueprint. A blueprint is a visual scripting which allows us to create a game without code. We started by setting up the camera which will allow us to view the viewport through an established angle.

                                        <p>After we place the actors, decide their functionalities, also determine how they will interact with the setting. The red cube is the player, which through nodes, will collide with the cylinder and move around. With the nodes, in the Event Graph we can determine how to move the player, in this case by assigning A, D, W, and S keys. Also, what can happen if it touches the bananas, here by using the node <i>DestroyActor</i>.
