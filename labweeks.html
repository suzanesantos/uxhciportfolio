                            <p>The tinkering process started with the brainstorm of the concepts. It is not always easy to get to the common ground of which message each one wants to convey. From the first day to the second with did some mind mapping and small illustrated concepts to be selected as our AR experience.  Although our concepts were differents we agreed to target the topic environment.</p>
                            <br>

                            <p>Further, we narrowed it down to materials as resources to everyday objects. As behind each object, there is a material used from nature. Not expressly mentioned but, consumerism is a subtopic that is part of the experience as we wanted to make the connection of the materials used in everyday objects to the consumers. The consciousness of consumption is, hence, part of the message. Another part of the message is how the materials affect consumers. This we would translate by “touching” the materials, the skin of the hand would change as an effect of the materials.</p><br>

                            <p>Below is our concept brainstorm mind-mapping.</p>

                            <p>Below is our chosen concept designed by Paulina Martina.</p><br>
                            <br>
                            <div>

                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>The original idea is that the users could see themselves reflected on a mirror and see their face changing as they thought the material with its respective texture.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>After defining the concept we started to think about the experience itself. How to translate the concept to the augmented reality experience? And with that which resources we would need to accomplish that. From that moment, several experiences started. As I had some experience with Spark AR, I suggested we could use it. Spark AR is an augmented reality software created by Facebook. It is this widely used to create augmented reality experiences by several companies such as <a href="https://jobs.gospooky.com/creative-developer-ar" class="assignment__link" target="_blank"> GoSpooky</a>and <a href="https://videorbit.com/portfolio/" class="assignment__link" target="_blank">VideOrbit</a>, both located in Amsterdam. As I’m interested to work with augmented reality and companies already use Spark AR, it seemed a good chance to explore and use AR. </p><br>
                            <p>I introduced Spark AR to my partner and explained its main features. Based on that we started building the experience. As she had never worked with Spark AR before, it was decided that I would create the experience and she would design the assets. However, when communicating our concept with the chosen software, by my partner and the tutor, important features were left out when conveying the software information. Spark AR is more than Instagram filters and it has the potential to deliver engaging augmented reality experiences by featuring sync effects, games, and AR e-commerce platform. As Spark AR seemed to promote limited features, the experience started there was aborted. At some point, it was tolerated for both parts as we were still in the exploration phase.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Below is the unfinished work initiated on Spark AR</p>
                            <br>
                            <div>

                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>We decided to move on and explore Unreal as we had some quick contact with this software during the AR workshop. We decided to follow some tutorials to get some knowledge beyond acquired during the workshop. From the tutorial of the workshop, we tested some interactions with our self-designed model, other moments with pre-made 3d animated assets.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Below is our model is applied to Unreal Engine by following the workshop tutorial.</p>
                            <br>
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">
                                <img src="assets/img/tinkering5.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">
                                <img src="assets/img/tinkering6.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>At this moment. We also reviewed our concept to see how it would be as Virtual Reality, also inspired by the AR/VR workshop based on the A-frame assignment. So we also started to check for VR tutorials. The tutorials were from Youtube and Unreal Engine Learning Page. However, most of them didn’t provide the interactions needed to inspire us to code/design our experience based on our thought concept. Most of the time, I just realized that after started the project after when following the tutorials. </p>
                            <br>
                             <p>A setback faced by one of them was after following the tutorial below we realized that an Oculus Quest would be required. For us renting one was out of option. By not having VR goggles, made us realized that some people wouldn’t have available even the cardboard available. By providing the experience through the mobile, which we assumed that would be more inclusive and without any further hardware needed. Therefore, we decided to go back to augmented reality.</p>
                             <br>
                             
                             <div>
                                 <div class="assignment__img">
                                 <img src="assets/img/tinkering4.png" alt="">
                                 </div>
                             </div>
                             <br>
                            <p>With the user in mind, I kept looking for an augmented reality platform that could easily host the experience. It was then when I stumble upon the 8th Wall. 8th Wall allows interactive experiences in the web browser, on mobile, or desktop. This WebAR platform was used by agencies to create engaging campaigns for big companies such as Burger King, Netflix, and Lego. </p><br>
                            <p>One positive point is that 8th Wall supports the 3D framework: A-Frame; besides another new 3D framework: Three.js. It made this WebAR platform become a well-known territory to a certain degree. That was also important as we were to design/customize our own 3D assets. So being able to export them and store them online as we co-create the experience was key. The 3D platform used to create/customize the 3D models was Vectary. I also introduced this 3D and augmented reality platform to my partner, based on my experience with my self-chosen assignment for XLAB A: 3D models for AR mobile applications. There, we could create and export the 3D models to our AR experience.</p><br>
                            <br>
                            
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">
                                <img src="assets/img/tinkering14.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>

                            <p>Another positive point is that 8th Wall provides several project templates, which could be customized and modified based on our concept. From that moment I started to explore a bit more 8th Wall through the available projects. Our final product contains elements from different projects, which we gave our own touch. We ended up co-coding the project as my partner could visualize the code as I shared the screen. Projects used as references will be mentioned below. As we wanted to add a feature, for instance, swap the texture of the arm, we used the “3D Model Swap”. Some feature, like making the 3D model disappear after a time; and placing the hotspots on top of the screen I had to search on places like W3School and SlackOverFlow.</p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">
                                <img src="assets/img/tinkering7.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>

                            <p>The final product was not created based on the original plan. Sometimes we had an idea, such as placing a background to the experience to make it more immersive. But after placing it we realized it was appearing to be virtual reality, and that was not the type of topic we were trying to design. Therefore we had some iterations and had to move back, revise the concept and check how to code the interactions. Many times it felt like we were going nowhere. Even to understand properly the concept and materialize it through the code was somehow challenging.</p> <br>
                            <div class="gallery">
                                
                                    <img src="assets/img/tinkering12.png" alt="">
                              
                                    <img src="assets/img/tinkering13.png" alt="">

                    </div>

                            <p>The A-Frame workshops were truly useful. We could have a good grasp of structure and key elements such as camera, 3D positioning, and scene. So after finding some features of different projects we searched through different channels, as aforementioned, how to add the elements we wanted. For instance, we were wanted to add an audio file to the scene but just placing the file in a sound tag didn’t work. So I went to check a project with sound. We tried to combine the codes. At the first moment, it didn’t work. The reason why is that a scene with a group standards such as xrweb and xrface doesn’t work together. But to know that I had to check 8th Wall documentation.</p><br>

                            <p>At the end we support each other, and although we previously had defined the tasks, we co-designed the product final several moments interchangeably. </p>

                     <br>
                     <p>This is an interesting topic as it opens doors for new forms of interaction between users and products/services. However, it is slightly hard, due to the time constraints, to quickly understand it and extend the assignment codes in a more creative and complex way.</p>
                    <br>
                        
                     <p>I believe designers will be able to bring these playful interactions to a more extended scale, and they will respond to a larger user group in a more complex way. For instance, a playful interaction will be able to be installed in a city and have input and output technologies spread out through it. </p>
                     <br>
                            
                         <p>I liked to have had some touch with this subject. I didn’t we would touch on this topic as UX Designers. It broadened my perceptions of our field scope, as it goes beyond screen interfaces. In addition, playfulness is an important component that should behave the same degree of importance, just like aesthetic, learnability, and usefulness.</p>

                            <strong>Exercise 5 C</strong>
                            <br>
                    <br>
                            <p>For this exercise, I added a random color to the sketch code and removed the blue color from the RGB.</p>
                            <br>
                                              <br>
                                              <strong>Exercise 5 E</strong>
                                              <br>
                                      <br>
                                              <p>For this task I combined two machine learning model codes, <a href="https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/face-api" class="assignment__link" target="_blank">faceapi</a> and <a href="https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/handpose" class="assignment__link" target="_blank">handpose</a>. Faceapi will detect some face landmarks, such as mouth, nose and jaw, by outlining them. Handpose, on the other, will detect palm and track hand-skeleton, by placing 21 3D keypoints on the hand.</p>
                                              <br>
                                              <p>For the faceapi, I changed the color of the eyes, mouth (besides its stroke weight) of the original code, and added a jaw outline to my extended code. To make it a bit more interesting, I added the handpose model to experience both models.</p>
