                            <p>The tinkering process started with the brainstorm of the concepts. It is not always easy to get to the common ground of which message each one wants to convey. From the first day to the second with did some mind mapping and small illustrated concepts to be selected as our AR experience.  Although our concepts were differents we agreed to target the topic environment.</p>
                            <br>

                            <p>Further, we narrowed it down to materials as resources to everyday objects. As behind each object, there is a material used from nature. Not expressly mentioned but, consumerism is a subtopic that is part of the experience as we wanted to make the connection of the materials used in everyday objects to the consumers. The consciousness of consumption is, hence, part of the message. Another part of the message is how the materials affect consumers. This we would translate by “touching” the materials, the skin of the hand would change as an effect of the materials.</p><br>

                            <p>Below is our concept brainstorm mind-mapping.</p>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            <p>Below is our chosen concept designed by Paulina Martina.</p><br>
                            <br>
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">

                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>The original idea is that the users could see themselves reflected on a mirror and see their face changing as they thought the material with its respective texture.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>After defining the concept we started to think about the experience itself. How to translate the concept to the augmented reality experience? And with that which resources we would need to accomplish that. From that moment, several experiences started. As I had some experience with Spark AR, I suggested we could use it. Spark AR is an augmented reality software created by Facebook. It is this widely used to create augmented reality experiences by several companies such as <a href="https://jobs.gospooky.com/creative-developer-ar" class="assignment__link" target="_blank"> GoSpooky</a>and <a href="https://videorbit.com/portfolio/" class="assignment__link" target="_blank">VideOrbit</a>, both located in Amsterdam. As I’m interested to work with augmented reality and companies already use Spark AR, it seemed a good chance to explore and use AR. </p><br>
                            <p>I introduced Spark AR to my partner and explained its main features. Based on that we started building the experience. As she had never worked with Spark AR before, it was decided that I would create the experience and she would design the assets. However, when communicating our concept with the chosen software, by my partner and the tutor, important features were left out when conveying the software information. Spark AR is more than Instagram filters and it has the potential to deliver engaging augmented reality experiences by featuring sync effects, games, and AR e-commerce platform. As Spark AR seemed to promote limited features, the experience started there was aborted. At some point, it was tolerated for both parts as we were still in the exploration phase.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Below is the unfinished work initiated on Spark AR</p>
                            <br>
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">

                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">
                                <img src="assets/img/tinkering3.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>We decided to move on and explore Unreal as we had some quick contact with this software during the AR workshop. We decided to follow some tutorials to get some knowledge beyond acquired during the workshop. From the tutorial of the workshop, we tested some interactions with our self-designed model, other moments with pre-made 3d animated assets.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Below is our model is applied to Unreal Engine by following the workshop tutorial.</p>
                            <br>
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">
                                <img src="assets/img/tinkering5.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">
                                <img src="assets/img/tinkering6.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>At this moment. We also reviewed our concept to see how it would be as Virtual Reality, also inspired by the AR/VR workshop based on the A-frame assignment. So we also started to check for VR tutorials. The tutorials were from Youtube and Unreal Engine Learning Page. However, most of them didn’t provide the interactions needed to inspire us to code/design our experience based on our thought concept. Most of the time, I just realized that after started the project after when following the tutorials. </p>
                            <br>
                             <p>A setback faced by one of them was after following the tutorial below we realized that an Oculus Quest would be required. For us renting one was out of option. By not having VR goggles, made us realized that some people wouldn’t have available even the cardboard available. By providing the experience through the mobile, which we assumed that would be more inclusive and without any further hardware needed. Therefore, we decided to go back to augmented reality.</p>
                             <br>
                             
                             <div>
                                 <div class="assignment__img">
                                 <img src="assets/img/tinkering4.png" alt="">
                                 </div>
                             </div>
                             <br>
                            <p>With the user in mind, I kept looking for an augmented reality platform that could easily host the experience. It was then when I stumble upon the 8th Wall. 8th Wall allows interactive experiences in the web browser, on mobile, or desktop. This WebAR platform was used by agencies to create engaging campaigns for big companies such as Burger King, Netflix, and Lego. </p><br>
                            <p>One positive point is that 8th Wall supports the 3D framework: A-Frame; besides another new 3D framework: Three.js. It made this WebAR platform become a well-known territory to a certain degree. That was also important as we were to design/customize our own 3D assets. So being able to export them and store them online as we co-create the experience was key. The 3D platform used to create/customize the 3D models was Vectary. I also introduced this 3D and augmented reality platform to my partner, based on my experience with my self-chosen assignment for XLAB A: 3D models for AR mobile applications. There, we could create and export the 3D models to our AR experience.</p><br>
                            <br>
                            
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">
                                <img src="assets/img/tinkering14.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>

                            <p>Another positive point is that 8th Wall provides several project templates, which could be customized and modified based on our concept. From that moment I started to explore a bit more 8th Wall through the available projects. Our final product contains elements from different projects, which we gave our own touch. We ended up co-coding the project as my partner could visualize the code as I shared the screen. Projects used as references will be mentioned below. As we wanted to add a feature, for instance, swap the texture of the arm, we used the “3D Model Swap”. Some feature, like making the 3D model disappear after a time; and placing the hotspots on top of the screen I had to search on places like W3School and SlackOverFlow.</p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <div>
                                <div class="assignment__img">
                                <img src="assets/img/tinkering7.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <br>

                            <p>The final product was not created based on the original plan. Sometimes we had an idea, such as placing a background to the experience to make it more immersive. But after placing it we realized it was appearing to be virtual reality, and that was not the type of topic we were trying to design. Therefore we had some iterations and had to move back, revise the concept and check how to code the interactions. Many times it felt like we were going nowhere. Even to understand properly the concept and materialize it through the code was somehow challenging.</p> <br>
                            <div class="gallery">
                                
                                    <img src="assets/img/tinkering12.png" alt="">
                              
                                    <img src="assets/img/tinkering13.png" alt="">

                    </div>

                            <p>The A-Frame workshops were truly useful. We could have a good grasp of structure and key elements such as camera, 3D positioning, and scene. So after finding some features of different projects we searched through different channels, as aforementioned, how to add the elements we wanted. For instance, we were wanted to add an audio file to the scene but just placing the file in a sound tag didn’t work. So I went to check a project with sound. We tried to combine the codes. At the first moment, it didn’t work. The reason why is that a scene with a group standards such as xrweb and xrface doesn’t work together. But to know that I had to check 8th Wall documentation.</p><br>

                            <p>At the end we support each other, and although we previously had defined the tasks, we co-designed the product final several moments interchangeably. </p>

                                <strong>Presentation and Explanation</strong>
                                <br>
                                <p>Merged Bio Experience is a product that users can experience, not only online but also in real life. We could say at the end it is a mixed-reality experience.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The augmented reality experience is part of an in-real-life exhibition. The biomaterials would be available for the users to see, touch and smell. This is how we translated the multi-sensorial factor. The biomaterials (squared objects in the movie) were composed of natural components such as the rest of eggshells, raspberries and coffee ground leftovers, and flowers.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>There (at the exhibition) the users could scan the QR code and be taken to the digital experience. We tried to replicate the materials digitally and make the users interact with them. When scanned, they could see first the concept explained through the texts, so they could first get the idea of what the experience is about. When the button is clicked they could get the instruction on how to interact with the materials. After swapping up the materials they could briefly see the history behind the displayed materials.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The music is there to enhance the experience by adding a mysterious effect.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The hotspots are there to add a surprising element, as the users click and two art pieces are revealed. The revealing feature was thought to don’t overload the screen with different 3D objects.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>After exploring the digital experience of the materials. The users would leave and go back to the in-real-life exhibition. There, portraits of bio skins (natural textures) would be displayed as shown in the video to be scanned with the Artivive app. Artivive is an augmented reality app that connects traditional art with digital art.</p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                    <strong>Informal Observations & Analysis</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>The overall experience when presenting our product was ok. I believe that we should have talked more about the product and its concept than about the process. That is because after saying about our product in a short time, I had the feeling not many people got the idea, due to the lack of reaction. Therefore, I believe that if we would briefly explain the concept of the in-real-life biomaterials and how they are translated to the digital experience, by starting briefly with the consumerism problem, probably we would have gotten more reactions.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Another point was the technological constraints. When we asked our colleagues to scan the QR code of the presentation slides, some of them were watching the expo on their mobiles and couldn’t scan it. Other because couldn’t scan QR code with their cameras. That we didn’t foresee.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Value & Relevance</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>I believe that the product itself could have presented more context to the concept. The users could have a bit more understanding of what is the goal of the product. There is a value in trying to make others more conscious about the objects which they use, by showing that behind them their materials which were and are taken from nature. With our product, we tried to make this connection between users and materials. </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Technologically, there were probably better ways to translate that. Augmented reality is a powerful tool and with take, we definitely could improve the product to convey a clearer and impactful experience. That would maybe involve using their surrounding objects as targets, to display the message and promote consciousness of more sustainable usage of biomaterials.</p>

                                    <h3 id="final-result"><i class='bx bx-right-arrow' style='color:#d8c19f'  ></i></i>General Reflection </h3>
                                    
                                    <strong>Process</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>As mentioned at the beginning of this we started the lab weeks by brainstorming some concepts and choosing one to create the interactive experience. During the first week, we spent most of the time exploring other tools. As I was testing the other tools, at the same time, we were refining the concept. Said that we were defining which extra interactions we wanted to have in the product as we go. As we were testing and exploring the tools we were posting and checking the other colleagues’ work. Sometimes it was confronting as seemed that our colleagues had everything figured out already and we were falling behind. </p><br>

                                    <b>On the other side, spending time exploring other software gave me the chance to be a bit more familiar with each tool. That will definitely be useful for the next projects, as I will have some more direction of where to build the experience. For instance, I would choose Unreal Engine for Virtual Reality experiences where it would have to track the users’ hand movements and add physic simulation, such as collision and damping. That would make a virtual experience much more responsive and immersive seeing how the assets react to the user.
                                    </p><br>

                                    <p>In the future I would suggest to once we have the main concept defined, we as a team would make a sitemap to define the action and reaction of each interaction. This way we, A: get to a common ground and understand what want to design based on the concept, and B: what and how must happen when the user interacts with the product. </p><br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Personal</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>I believe that with this project I put myself into uncomfortable places in benefit of the project. By that, I mean with code. We ended up creating our project on a tool that we were not so comfortable with but still went through it. Several times I wanted to give up on code and move back to other tools such as Unreal or try Unity because it seemed to have less code. However, I kept doing and tried to find the answer to some of our questions in different ways, such as A-frame’s website and the documentation. The last was one of the most important skills applied during this lab week - knowing how to use documentation. They are resourceful, and I used many times to try to find the answers.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Personally I believe I should speak up more, so I can properly convey my ideas and other’s ideas. During these lab weeks, I struggled to understand all the interactions as a whole, as I saw it constantly adding up. I don’t think that an interactive experience should have several places to click. The concept of Biomaterials and Bio skins and what is the goal here is quite complex. Placing too many assets and too many clickable elements is unnecessary and just makes it more confusing for the user. Therefore, next time, I will speak up and advocate for simplicity. It is good for the user, and for the process.  </p>
