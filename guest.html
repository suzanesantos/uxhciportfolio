                                </div>
                                
                            </div>
                          
                            
                    
                    <p>One of the projects presented that caught my attention was the Arcade because it creates a feeling of being in a parallel dimension. The technology used is similar to the Dell Experience Conference augmented reality experience, created by Aircards in partnership with CXO Strategies. Both projects use the portal feature from ARkit, which enhances this immersive experience.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>The Arcadeâ€™s intended goal was to create an inter-dimensional portal AR experience, based on the Strange Things series. To experience it, the users must have in hand their mobile phone to visualize the arcade machine and access the portal to The Upside Down World. When the users access the portal, they can hear 3d sounds (responsive to the position of the user) and see interactive thunder effects.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>The users access the project through the app installed on a mobile phone. Two of the sensors contained in a mobile phone are microphones, accelerometers (which reads the orientation relative to the frame of reference of the mobile phone), and cameras. As actuators, the most common and largely used are the screens and the speakers.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>This project is interesting because it explores and plays with the spatial awareness of the users. They can turn 360 degrees and see the whole interface. Notably, it makes users be more actively involved in the experience. Another element that makes this experience engaging is the element of surprise. All of the sudden, a monster jumps over the user. That can generate several reactions. For the following times, users know what to expect but still have some degree of anticipation when experiencing it. </p>
