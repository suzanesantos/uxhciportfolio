                            <p>This wearable concept is based on glasses that would provide some mobile features like a speaker, microphone, and MicroLED displays.  That would allow the user to see the person’s picture of who they are talking to. The glasses supporters would have ultra-thin Piezo film speakers so they would hear also music. A microphone module would be placed in the nose’s glass supporter. Videos could be also displayed on one small frame displayed on the glasses. A Wireless Module Transceiver would be used to connect to the mobile.</p>

<br>
                    <p>Fitbit is a mainstream fitness tracker, mainly used for health matters, such as counting steps or calories and continuous heart rate. Since its release n 2014, the company kept its main design with silicon armbands and slightly chunky shape. That matched with the main purpose of the product that was to track information during physical activities. But what I think interesting about the Fitbit is that they are expand the style range beyond the fitness style. The company partered with a fashion label to transform its sportive stample into jewlery.

                        <p>For 2 weeks I worked with Arduino, which is an open-source electronics platform for building prototypes. It gave us, students, the opportunity to practice through some exercises which are displayed throughout this page. Arduino combines hardware with software and is suitable to assist in designing interactive environments and objects.</p>

                                <p>This exercised required that a LED lamps alternate the power. That was possible by coding a loop function.</p>
                                <p>For the first second, the green LED lamp, connected to pin 13,  will have the voltage level HIGH and after 1 second LOW. This will be reversed for the other LED lamp. For the yellow LED lamp, connected to pin 12, the voltage will be LOW and after one second it will be HIGH. This loop creates then an alternate sequence.</p>

                                        <p>The task here required that one LED slowly fades in and the other fades out simultaneously. In the code, 255 is the maximum brightness power it can get. The brightness of the green LED pin increases gradually until it reaches its maximum.  For the yellow LED pin, it will work reversely. It will happen by setting it to start from the maximum brightness, 255, minus the brightness integer. As result, one LED pin fades out as its voltage decreases gradually while the other LED pin fades in as its voltage increases. </p>

That was possible by using the input of a potentiometer, to power the LED pins and print out the sensor values. This exercise showed how to employ an analog input to regulate an analog output. In order to alternate the output, the brightness equation of Exercise 4 was added to create this effect.  </p>

That was achievable with a LED Matrix component.  To configure it we used a couple of functions, such as setRow (for the rows) and setCol (for the columns). A code was provided so we could make a smiley face and a frowny face be displayed on the LED matrix. The image displayed will alternate each second. </p>
